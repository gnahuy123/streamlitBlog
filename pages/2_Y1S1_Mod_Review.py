    4 hours of Lectures a week 2 hours of tutorials and 1 hour of recitations. This coupled with the homework assignments lead to a module with highworkload. Sometimes the lectures would get too dry and I would watch them at 2x speed

         take up alot of time but comparatively less brainpower

    There are many student initiated projects such as the source academy game(educational game), a robotics component and many more creative missions that allow us to create art/music. Even though all these were made available and accessible

         to be the most enjoyable modules amongst my friends so your experience might differ from mine.
